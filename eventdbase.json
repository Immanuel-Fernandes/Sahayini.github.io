It was organized by the NDF for all the FMA Provinces. There were 23 participants and there was a lot of excitement and joy in meeting the sisters of other provinces and exchange news. The pleasant and soothing atmosphere of the Wellington hills and the aroma of the tea gardens was an added benefit of the seminar. The entire programme was well planned and our efficient resource person Fr. Joe SJ made it very interesting and participatory with his expertise and experience on the subject. The various responsibilities of the seminar were distributed well in advance to different provinces by the NDF team headed by Sr. Isabella Alphonse. \r\nThe day began with a prayerful and well animated morning prayer followed by the Eucharistic celebration. At 9.00 am we began with the inauguration of the seminar during which the Provincial of the Chennai province, Sr. Magnificat Soosai in her key note address, gave us a brief history of the inception and the development of the child protection policy. She urged the participants to make the best use of this TOT and equip ourselves to uphold the rights of the children in our institutions.  \r\nWith initial introduction by the participants, Fr. Joe gave us a gist of the whole training programme. He then presented the previously prepared modules for Parents, teachers and children. The group felt the need for a 4th module for sisters. A few people with little more experience on the implementation of the policy and who had helped in the development of the other modules were given the responsibility of  preparing the 4th module. We were then divided into groups to go through the particular modules and make modifications to make it more interesting and creative.  On the second day each of the groups then presented the modified training modules and got a feedback from the rest of the participants. On the last day, Fr. Joe gave us a brief explanation on the steps followed for criminal cases in a Trial Court. The presentation of issues on child abuse most commonly faced in our institutions was acted out by 2 groups trying to apply the steps and lessons learned in dealing with them. A lot of questions arose which were answered efficiently and painstakingly with expertise and experience. This further helped the group to clarify their doubts and raise questions thus making the policy clearer to the participants.\r\nWe also had the sharing of experiences by different participants in the implementation of the policy. It was a very enriching sharing. This also resulted in putting down a ready-list of practical guidelines to be followed by CPOs and the organisations.  We now had ready modules and presentation resources to take back with us as trainers on Child Protection for various groups.\r\nThe seminar ended with a thanksgiving programme and a short evaluation during which every participant voiced out their sentiments of gratitude and satisfaction and spoke on the benefit of the TOT for each one of them. It was very clear that everyone benefited from this well animated training and we felt the desire to implement it in our settings in order to make the children aware of the danger and protect   them from abuse and violence. \r\nSr. Rita Lobo","event_date":"2016-07-22","location":"Wellington, Chennai","image":"497437039_3042889875912875_5111380402689644061_n.jpg","created_at":"2025-08-24 19:12:49"},

We need to create a ‘child friendly’ environment by making our presence felt, by making this information visible around our communities. He went on to tell us that it is of prime importance to maintain documentation of matters related to child protection in order to ensure safety for the child and our institution; this would give a positive view that we are concerned about child protection. It is imperative for security purposes to keep record of visitors. He highlighted the protection of women from sexual harassment as per the Vishaka Judgement of 1997. \r\nDuring the course of the workshop there were a few group discussions based on ‘Relationship between our charism and rights of children’ and ‘child abuse cases’ that we might have come across or heard of.\r\nFr. Joe presented the FMA-India CPP so well that it was easily understood by all. All the important points were reviewed and revised and doubts clarified.

The offices of the Principal and Superior need to be modified while maintaining security and privacy, keeping with the need of the hour i.e. using glass partitions; this will give out a positive signal in regard to child protection and transparency.

Our SHG women with the Sarpanch planted the saplings in the School grounds of Jhalabodi and Ardi villages, thanks to the 200 plants received from the Nagarpallika. Later, the girls too joined in planting in different places, the idea being: save the girl child and let her grow.  \r\nRecently, we received a Bal Swaraj project from Kaira Social Service Society to form a Children’s Parliament in Jhalabodi, Ardi and Pansora villages, which was carried out with the support of the Principal and Teachers.

{"id":"181","title":"Child Protection Awareness Programme - KOPARKHAIRANE","description":"In  the month of September Sr.  Collette Gonsalves gave an awareness talk to our teachers of the Out-reach programme. We made them aware of the importance of good and bad touch; how they should be alert and attentive to all that is happening to the child, their behaviour in the class and during recreation. We also gave them information on the action to be taken and to whom they should approach. They were very happy with this input session.\r\nSr. Moksha Anthon conducted a similar one-hour session for our Sunday School children   and Anmol girls on CPP. They were made more aware also of good behaviour and bad behaviour, who can do harm and when it can happen.  All this took place through open discussion. The children are not unaware of all this. They showed lot of interest.  \r\nDuring the regular Karate classes for our Anmol girls they are taught how to defend and protect themselves.\r\nOn the occasion of Gandhi Jayanthi, Sr. Collete, along with the Anmol Girls and the Novices organised a short awareness programme for the children, youth and people of the Rabale village on the Child Protection Policy, by staging a street play through which they impressively brought forth the present situation of most women and girls in their own homes and how they need to be bold enough to protect themselves and be freed from these abusive situations. Many suggestions were placed before all of them as to how they could receive help from the police, NGOs and most importantly from their own family. The toll free child protection number 1098 was also announced to them in order that any child may make use of it in time of crisis and be assured of timely help.  After the play the children of the area along with the Anmol Girls sang aloud HUM HONGE KAMYAB. \r\nWe distributed sweets to all. Our only wish and prayer is that our message reaches the minds and hearts of the people and make them, especially the women and girls, better prepared to face such lurking evils of society.","event_date":"2015-09-28","location":"KOPARKHAIRANE","image":"495240156_3036612013207328_3899578196250811273_n.jpg","created_at":"2025-08-24 20:36:58"},
